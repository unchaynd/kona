# Kona
Kona is a computer language I am creating that is meant to be beautiful, powerful, efficient, and compatible.

Please feel free to submit issues with any thoughts or suggestions you have! :D

## The basic goals of Kona
1. It should be fun and easy to use.
2. It should be visually beautiful, and easy to read and understand.
3. It should be Turing-complete.
4. A given block of Kona code should be executable by any Turing-complete hardware (given appropriate translation).
5. It should allow the same control over the hardware that the hardware's machine code allows, when the user wants this kind of control. In this case, the hardware-dependent elements of the code would be exempt from the previous point.
6. It should allow arbitrarily low-level manipulation of and operation on digital data.
7. At runtime, everything outside the user's control should be perfectly efficient. Where tradeoffs are necessary, the user should be given full control over these tradeoffs.
8. The user should never have to sacrifice code efficiency for code beauty, readability, maintainability, flexibility, or integrity.
